# üîê Authentication Security Enhancement Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring enhanced authentication security in the BuyMartV1 Supabase project to address the remaining security gaps identified by the database linter.

## üéØ Security Objectives
- ‚úÖ Enable leaked password protection against HaveIBeenPwned.org
- ‚úÖ Configure additional MFA options for enhanced account security
- ‚úÖ Strengthen password requirements
- ‚úÖ Implement enterprise-grade authentication security

---

## üìã **PHASE 1: LEAKED PASSWORD PROTECTION**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Authentication Settings**
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pbydepsqcypwqbicnsco/auth/settings
2. Scroll to the "Security" section

### **Step 2: Enable Leaked Password Protection**
**Configuration Options:**
- ‚úÖ **Enable "Leaked password protection"**
- ‚úÖ **Check passwords against HaveIBeenPwned.org database**
- ‚úÖ **Block registration with compromised passwords**
- ‚úÖ **Force password reset for existing compromised passwords**

**Expected Behavior:**
- Users with compromised passwords will be prompted to reset
- New registrations with known breached passwords will be blocked
- Enhanced security against credential stuffing attacks

---

## üìã **PHASE 2: MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)**

### **Step 1: Navigate to MFA Settings**
1. Stay in: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pbydepsqcypwqbicnsco/auth/settings
2. Scroll to "Multi-Factor Authentication" section

### **Step 2: Enable Additional MFA Methods**
**Recommended MFA Options:**

#### **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)** ‚úÖ PRIORITY
- **Enable**: TOTP authentication
- **Compatible Apps**: Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, Bitwarden
- **Benefits**: Works offline, highly secure, widely supported

#### **WebAuthn (Hardware Security Keys)** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
- **Enable**: WebAuthn support
- **Compatible Devices**: YubiKey, TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello
- **Benefits**: Phishing-resistant, hardware-backed security

#### **Phone/SMS** ‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL
- **Enable**: SMS-based MFA (if available in your region)
- **Note**: Less secure than TOTP/WebAuthn but better than no MFA
- **Considerations**: Carrier-dependent, SIM swapping risks

### **Step 3: Configure MFA Enforcement (Optional)**
**For High-Security Users:**
- Consider requiring MFA for admin accounts
- Implement conditional MFA based on user roles
- Set up backup recovery codes

## üìã **PHASE 3: PASSWORD STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Password Settings**
1. Stay in: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pbydepsqcypwqbicnsco/auth/settings
2. Find "Password Requirements" section

### **Step 2: Configure Enhanced Password Requirements**
**Recommended Settings:**
- ‚úÖ **Minimum length**: 12 characters (up from default 8)
- ‚úÖ **Require uppercase letters**: A-Z
- ‚úÖ **Require lowercase letters**: a-z
- ‚úÖ **Require numbers**: 0-9
- ‚úÖ **Require special characters**: !@#$%^&*
- ‚úÖ **Prevent common passwords**: Block dictionary words
- ‚úÖ **Prevent sequential characters**: Block 123456, abcdef

**Password Strength Benefits:**
- Resistance to brute force attacks
- Protection against dictionary attacks
- Compliance with security standards
- Reduced risk of credential compromise

---

## üìã **PHASE 4: ADDITIONAL SECURITY CONFIGURATIONS**

### **Step 1: Session Management**
**Recommended Settings:**
- **Session timeout**: 24 hours (adjust based on security needs)
- **Refresh token rotation**: Enable for enhanced security
- **Concurrent sessions**: Limit to reasonable number (e.g., 5)

### **Step 2: Rate Limiting**
**Configure Rate Limits:**
- **Login attempts**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Password reset**: 3 attempts per hour
- **Registration**: 10 attempts per hour per IP

### **Step 3: Email Security**
**Email Configuration:**
- **Email confirmation**: Required for new accounts
- **Email change confirmation**: Required for email updates
- **Secure email templates**: Use branded, professional templates

---

## üß™ **TESTING & VERIFICATION**

### **Test 1: Leaked Password Protection**
1. **Create test account** with known compromised password (e.g., "password123")
2. **Verify blocking**: Registration should be prevented
3. **Check error message**: Should indicate password is compromised
4. **Test existing users**: Compromised passwords should trigger reset

### **Test 2: MFA Functionality**
1. **Enable MFA** on test account
2. **Test TOTP**: Set up authenticator app, verify codes work
3. **Test WebAuthn**: Register security key or biometric, verify login
4. **Test backup codes**: Generate and test recovery codes

### **Test 3: Password Requirements**
1. **Test weak passwords**: Should be rejected
2. **Test strong passwords**: Should be accepted
3. **Verify error messages**: Clear guidance on requirements
4. **Test password reset**: New passwords must meet requirements

### **Test 4: Overall Authentication Flow**
1. **Registration**: Test complete signup process
2. **Login**: Test various authentication methods
3. **Password reset**: Test forgot password flow
4. **Account recovery**: Test MFA backup methods
