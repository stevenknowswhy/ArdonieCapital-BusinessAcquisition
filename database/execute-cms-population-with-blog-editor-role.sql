-- ALTERNATIVE CMS DATA POPULATION SCRIPT WITH BLOG_EDITOR ROLE

-- Project: pbydepsqcypwqbicnsco

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: ADD BLOG_EDITOR TO USER_ROLE ENUM
-- ============================================================================

-- Add 'blog_editor' to the existing user_role enum
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'blog_editor';

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: FIX USER PERMISSIONS FOR CONTENT CREATION
-- ============================================================================

-- Update user permissions for content creation
UPDATE profiles

    last_name = 'Manager',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = (

-- Create profile if it doesn't exist

WHERE au.email = 'reforiy538@iamtile.com'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p WHERE p.user_id = au.id
);

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 3: INSERT BLOG POSTS (SAME AS SIMPLIFIED VERSION)
-- ============================================================================

-- Get the author_id and insert blog posts
DO $$
DECLARE
