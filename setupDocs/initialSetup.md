**Project: Modern Frontend Starter for [Your Platform Name] - A Business Acquisition Platform**

**Platform Mission (to guide design):**
"[Your Platform Name] is to transform how entrepreneurs and investors buy and sell small businessesâ€”streamlining acquisitions from months to weeks. By combining intelligent matchmaking, integrated legal and financial tools, standardized processes, and hands-on support, we deliver faster, simpler, and more trusted transactions that fuel economic opportunity."

**Platform Vision (to guide design):**
"[Your Platform Name] is to redefine small business acquisitions by building the leading platform where entrepreneurs and investors connect to buy and sell with speed, trust, and simplicity. By powering billions in future transactions through innovative technology, strategic partnerships, and standardized deal infrastructure, we aim to unlock a more accessible, dynamic market that drives economic growth across communities."

**Objective:**
Generate the HTML structure and Tailwind CSS styling for the key frontend pages of [Your Platform Name]. The design should be exceptionally modern, intuitive, trustworthy, and efficient, directly reflecting our mission to streamline and simplify business acquisitions. It should feel like a sophisticated fintech or SaaS platform, going beyond a traditional listing site.

**Core Pages to Generate (MVP with modern enhancements):**

1.  **Homepage (`index.html`)**
2.  **Search & Discovery Page (`search-discovery.html`)** (Evolved from simple search results)
3.  **Business Profile Page (`business-profile.html`)** (Evolved from listing detail)
4.  **User Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)** (For buyers/sellers)
5.  **(Conceptual) Deal Room / Acquisition Workflow Page (`deal-room.html`)** (Focus on layout and key component placeholders)

**General Styling & UX/UI Best Practices:**

*   **Aesthetic:** Clean, minimalist, sophisticated, data-driven, and trustworthy. Think modern SaaS/Fintech.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Primary: A strong, modern blue (e.g., `bg-indigo-600`, `text-indigo-600`) or a professional dark teal.
    *   Secondary: Lighter shades of the primary, or complementary grays (e.g., `bg-slate-100`, `text-slate-700`).
    *   Accent: A vibrant color for key CTAs that signals action and progress (e.g., a bright green `bg-green-500` for success/next step, or a dynamic orange).
    *   Neutrals: Off-whites, various shades of gray for text, backgrounds, and borders (`bg-white`, `text-slate-900`, `border-slate-200`).
*   **Typography:**
    *   Font Family: Modern, highly legible sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Manrope, or similar via Tailwind's default sans stack). Prioritize clarity and hierarchy.
    *   Spacing: Generous whitespace, consistent padding/margins for a breathable layout. Use Tailwind's spacing scale effectively.
*   **Interactivity (Visual Cues & Structure for JS):**
    *   Hover states, focus states for all interactive elements.
    *   Smooth transitions (can be suggested with Tailwind classes, actual implementation is JS/CSS).
    *   Placeholders for interactive elements like charts, progress bars, dynamic filters.
*   **Iconography:**
    *   Use modern, clean line icons. Suggest using a popular library like Heroicons (SVG) or Lucide Icons if the AI can structure for them (e.g., `<!-- [ICON: search] -->` or `<svg>...</svg>` if it can generate).
*   **Components:**
    *   Buttons: Clear visual distinction between primary, secondary, and tertiary actions. Pill-shaped or slightly rounded.
    *   Cards: Modern card design with clean information hierarchy, potentially with subtle hover effects.
    *   Forms: User-friendly, with clear labels, inline validation message placeholders, and logical grouping.
    *   Modals & Popovers: Structure for these common interactive elements.
    *   Progress Indicators: For multi-step processes (e.g., in the Deal Room).
*   **Accessibility (Considerations for Structure):**
    *   Semantic HTML5.
    *   Good color contrast (implied by palette choices).
    *   Keyboard navigation affordances (focus states).

**Technical Requirements:**

*   Use **HTML5** semantic markup.
*   Use **Tailwind CSS** (latest version) for all styling. Maximize use of utility classes.
*   Ensure excellent **responsiveness** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
*   Include **comments** for sections, complex components, and interactivity placeholders.
*   Structure HTML to be **JavaScript-friendly** for future interactivity (e.g., unique IDs for elements to be manipulated, proper data attributes).
*   Consider **Dark Mode** readiness (e.g., use Tailwind's `dark:` variants where appropriate, even if not fully implemented by the AI).

**Output:**
Please provide the content for `index.html`, `search-discovery.html`, `business-profile.html`, `dashboard.html`, and `deal-room.html` as separate, complete HTML files with embedded Tailwind CSS (or linked if the AI can manage a base CSS file with Tailwind imports).
