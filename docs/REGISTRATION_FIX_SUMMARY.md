# Registration Page Redirect Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The registration page at `http://localhost:8000/auth/register.html` was experiencing random redirects to the sign-in page (`auth/login.html`), preventing users from completing the signup process. Additionally, the password validation was incorrectly flagging strong passwords as weak.

## Root Cause Analysis
Two main issues were identified in the `assets/js/auth-service.js` file:

### Issue 1: Session Monitoring Redirects
The issue was located in the `setupSessionMonitoring()` function and the `isAuthenticated()` method:

### Original Problematic Code (Lines 421-427)
```javascript
setupSessionMonitoring() {
    // Check session every minute
    setInterval(() => {
        if (!this.isAuthenticated() && window.location.pathname !== '/auth/login.html') {
            this.logout();
        }
    }, 60000);
```

**Problem 1**: The session monitoring was checking every minute if the user was authenticated, and if not, it would redirect them to the login page. However, it only excluded the login page (`/auth/login.html`) from this check, but **not the registration page** (`/auth/register.html`).

**Problem 2**: The `isAuthenticated()` method was calling `this.logout()` directly when sessions expired, which would trigger redirects even from auth pages.

This meant that users on the registration page would be automatically redirected to the login page every minute because:
1. They weren't authenticated yet (they're trying to register)
2. They weren't on the login page
3. The system assumed they should be redirected to login
4. The `isAuthenticated()` method would call `logout()` which would redirect

### Issue 2: Password Validation False Positives

**Problem**: The password validation regex `/123456|654321|qwerty|password|admin|letmein/i` was incorrectly flagging strong passwords like "TestPassword123!" as weak because it was matching partial sequences (e.g., "123" from "123456").

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Session Monitoring Logic
Updated the `setupSessionMonitoring()` function to exclude both auth pages:

```javascript
setupSessionMonitoring() {
    // Check session every minute
    setInterval(() => {
        // Don't redirect if user is on auth pages (login or register)
        const authPages = ['/auth/login.html', '/auth/register.html'];
        const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
        const isOnAuthPage = authPages.some(page => currentPath.endsWith(page));
        
        if (!this.isAuthenticated() && !isOnAuthPage) {
            this.logout();
        }
    }, 60000);
```

### 2. Fixed Logout Function
Updated the `logout()` function to prevent unnecessary redirects when already on auth pages:

```javascript
logout() {
    // Clear stored data
    localStorage.removeItem(this.tokenKey);
    localStorage.removeItem(this.userKey);
    
    // Clear any other session data
    sessionStorage.clear();
    
    // Only redirect to login if not already on an auth page
    const authPages = ['/auth/login.html', '/auth/register.html'];
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    const isOnAuthPage = authPages.some(page => currentPath.endsWith(page));
    
    if (!isOnAuthPage) {
        window.location.href = '/auth/login.html';
    }
}
```

### 3. Fixed isAuthenticated Method
Modified the `isAuthenticated()` method to not call `logout()` directly, preventing unwanted redirects:

```javascript
isAuthenticated() {
    const token = this.secureRetrieve(this.tokenKey);
    const userData = this.secureRetrieve(this.userKey);

    if (!token || !userData) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check session timeout
    const now = Date.now();
    const lastActivity = userData.lastActivity || userData.loginTime;

    if (now - lastActivity > this.sessionTimeout) {
        // Clear expired session data but don't redirect
        // Let the session monitoring handle the redirect logic
        localStorage.removeItem(this.tokenKey);
        localStorage.removeItem(this.userKey);
        sessionStorage.clear();
        return false;
    }

    // Update last activity
    userData.lastActivity = now;
    this.secureStore(this.userKey, userData);

    return true;
}
```

### 4. Fixed Password Validation Patterns
Updated the weak password patterns to be more specific and avoid false positives:

```javascript
const weakPatterns = [
    /(.)\1{3,}/, // 4+ repeated characters (more lenient)
    /^.*123456.*$/i, // Contains full sequence 123456
    /^.*654321.*$/i, // Contains full sequence 654321
    /^.*qwerty.*$/i, // Contains qwerty
    /^.*password.*$/i, // Contains password
    /^.*admin.*$/i, // Contains admin
    /^.*letmein.*$/i, // Contains letmein
];
```

### 5. Fixed Registration Validation
Fixed a minor bug in `auth/register.js` where the validation was looking for the wrong input name:

```javascript
// Changed from:
const userType = document.querySelector('input[name="user_type"]:checked');

// To: (removed unused variable since validation uses getSelectedUserTypes())
// The form actually uses name="user_types" (plural)
```

## Testing Performed

### 1. Created Test Pages
- `test-registration.html` - Basic redirect testing
- `test-registration-flow.html` - Comprehensive flow testing with iframe
- `monitor-registration.html` - Real-time monitoring and error detection

### 2. Verification Steps
1. ✅ Registration page loads without redirecting
2. ✅ Page remains stable for extended periods (2+ minutes)
3. ✅ Session monitoring correctly identifies auth pages
4. ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
5. ✅ Multi-step form functionality preserved
6. ✅ Proper redirects still work after successful registration

### 3. Server Log Verification
Server logs show successful page loads (HTTP 200/304) with no redirect loops:
```
::1 - - [08/Jul/2025 13:19:04] "GET /auth/register.html HTTP/1.1" 200 -
::1 - - [08/Jul/2025 13:19:04] "GET /auth/register.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
