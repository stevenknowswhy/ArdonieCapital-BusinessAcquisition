-[ ] NAME:I want to refactor the BuyMartV1 codebase to improve organization and maintainability while ensuring zero functionality loss. Please: DESCRIPTION:1. **Analyze the current codebase structure** to understand the existing organization and identify files that need reorganization  2. **Create a logical folder structure** that follows these principles:    - Group related files by feature/functionality (following our established feature-colocation model)    - Separate development/testing files from production code    - Maintain clear separation between frontend pages, components, services, and assets  3. **Reorganize the following file types** into appropriate directories:    - Debug files and development scripts    - Test files (*.test.js, *.spec.js, etc.)    - Documentation files (*.md, README files, etc.)    - Development configuration files    - Any temporary or build artifacts  4. **Proposed structure** should include directories like:    - `/docs/` - for all documentation and markdown files    - `/tests/` - for test files and testing utilities    - `/dev/` or `/scripts/` - for development scripts and debug files    - Maintain existing `/components/`, `/services/`, `/assets/` structure for production code  5. **Safety requirements**:    - Do NOT move or modify any production HTML pages, CSS, or JavaScript files that are actively serving the website    - Preserve all relative path references and imports    - Test that the website still functions after reorganization    - Create a backup plan or document the changes for easy rollback if needed  6. **Deliverables**:    - Proposed new folder structure    - List of files to be moved and their new locations    - Any necessary updates to import paths or references    - Verification that all website functionality remains intact  Please start by analyzing the current codebase structure and proposing the reorganization plan before making any file moves.
-[ ] NAME:Let's analze this codebase against the rules and guidelines instruction to document any files that will need to be changed or updated to match the rules and guidelines and create a file to plan to update the codebase to meet the rules and guildeline requirements. Do not change or move any files yet this is just the planning stage.  DESCRIPTION:### The Definitive Modular Development Guide for VS Code Augment AI Our Philosophy Our primary goal is to create a codebase that is scalable, maintainable, and easy for developers to navigate. We prioritize long-term health over short-term convenience. Every rule in this guide is designed to support a system where features are isolated, dependencies are explicit, and code is easy to understand, test, and safely delete.  1. Directory Structure: The Feature-Colocation Model This is the most critical rule. We organize our codebase by feature, not by file type.  Rule: All files related to a single feature—components, hooks, services, types, tests, and styles—must reside within a single, top-level feature directory. Rationale: This creates self-contained modules. When you work on the "user-profile," everything you need is in src/features/user-profile/. This dramatically reduces cognitive load and makes code discovery intuitive. Example Structure: src/ ├── features/ │   └── user-profile/ │       ├── components/ │       │   ├── user-avatar.component.tsx │       │   └── user-details.component.tsx │       ├── hooks/ │       │   └── use-user-profile.hook.ts │       ├── tests/ │       │   ├── use-user-profile.hook.test.ts │       │   └── user-avatar.component.test.tsx │       ├── user-profile.service.ts │       ├── user-profile.types.ts │       └── index.ts  // The public API for this module │ └── shared/     ├── components/  // Truly generic, reusable UI (Button, Input, Modal)     ├── hooks/       // App-wide hooks (use-local-storage)     └── utils/       // Pure helper functions (format-date) The shared/ Directory: For code that is genuinely application-agnostic and used across multiple features (e.g., a generic Button component, a formatDate utility), place it in the shared/ directory. Be critical: if it's only used by two related features, it may be better to duplicate it until a clearer pattern emerges. 2. Naming Conventions: Predictability is King A file's name should tell you its purpose and location in the architecture without opening it.  Rule: Use kebab-case for all files and folders. Suffix files with their role (e.g., .component.tsx, .hook.ts, .service.ts, .types.ts, .test.ts). Rule: Avoid generic names. A page route should be named after its feature, like user-profile-page.tsx, never page.tsx or index.tsx. Rule: Component prop types should be named ComponentNameProps. Rationale: Consistency removes ambiguity and guesswork. It makes searching for files and understanding the codebase at a glance significantly faster. Examples: Good: use-auth-status.hook.ts, auth.service.ts, auth-page.tsx, AuthPageProps Bad: useAuth.js, AuthSvc.ts, index.js, AuthPage_Props 3. Granularity & Responsibility: Keep It Small, Keep It Focused Rule: Files should not exceed 500 lines. Functions should not exceed 30 lines. Rationale: Large files and functions are a code smell indicating they are doing too much. Small, focused units are easier to understand, test, and reuse. What to Extract from a Large Component: Child Components: Break down complex UI into smaller, presentational components. Custom Hooks: All state management, data fetching, and side-effect logic must be extracted into a custom hook (e.g., use-user-profile.hook.ts). The component itself should be as "dumb" as possible. Utilities: Pure data transformation logic should be moved to a utils.ts file. Constants: Magic strings or numbers should be defined in a constants.ts file. 4. State Management: A Hierarchical Approach Rule: Choose the most local state management solution possible. Rationale: Placing state as close as possible to where it's used prevents unnecessary re-renders and makes data flow easier to trace. The Hierarchy: Local State (useState, useReducer): The default choice. Use for state that is entirely contained within a single component (e.g., whether a dropdown is open). Feature State (React Context): Use when multiple components within the same feature need to share state. The Context Provider should be placed at the root of that feature's component tree, not at the application root. Global State (Zustand, Redux): Use only for truly global, cross-cutting state that many unrelated features depend on. Examples: user authentication status, application theme, session information. 5. Dependency Management: The Module "API Contract" Rule: Modules must only be imported via their index.ts barrel file. Never deep-import into a feature's internal files from outside that feature. Rationale: The index.ts file acts as a formal "API" or "contract" for the module. It defines what is public and what is private. This allows the feature's internal structure to be refactored at any time without breaking other parts of the application. Example: typescript Copy Code // In src/features/user-profile/index.ts export { UserProfilePage } from './user-profile-page'; export { useUserProfile } from './hooks/use-user-profile.hook';  // In another feature (e.g., src/features/dashboard/...) // GOOD: Respects the module's public API contract. import { useUserProfile } from '@/features/user-profile';  // BAD: Violates the contract by accessing a private implementation detail. import { useUserProfile } from '@/features/user-profile/hooks/use-user-profile.hook'; Rule: Organize imports into three groups, separated by a blank line: 1. External libraries, 2. Internal absolute paths (@/features/...), 3. Relative paths (./...). 6. Testing: Integrated and Co-located Rule: Test files must live alongside the code they are testing, either in a tests/ sub-directory or with a .test.ts suffix. Rationale: This makes it easy to find tests and encourages developers to write them, as the test file is right next to the source file. It also means when you delete a feature, you delete its tests automatically. Strategy: Utilities/Services: Use a tool like Vitest or Jest for pure unit tests. Components/Hooks: Use React Testing Library to test behavior from a user's perspective. Test that the component renders the correct state from its hook, and that user interactions work as expected. Do not test implementation details. The Definitive Modular Development Guide for VS Code Augment AI  Table of Contents  - Our Philosophy - 1. Directory Structure: Feature-Colocation Model - 2.

New: Backend Structure and Best Practices - Enforcement and Evolution  Our Philosophy   Our primary goal is a scalable, maintainable codebase that's easy to navigate and evolve. We prioritize long-term health over short-term shortcuts: features are isolated, dependencies explicit, and code is understandable, testable, and deletable without side effects. This guide enforces modularity inspired by feature-driven development, ensuring Augment AI—a modern, responsive full-stack app—delivers excellent UI/UX while integrating intelligent VS Code tools. We embrace best practices for frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Node.js/Express) to build performant, secure, and user-centric experiences.  1. Directory Structure: Feature-Colocation Model   Organize by feature, not file type, to create self-contained modules. Extend this to backend for full-stack consistency.  Rule: Frontend: All files for a feature live under src/features/. Backend: Mirror with src/backend/features/ for APIs/services. Rationale: Reduces cognitive load and simplifies full-stack refactoring. Do: Export public APIs via index.ts. Don't: Scatter files by type.  Example Structure (Frontend + Backend Snippet):   	src/ 	├── features/  // Frontend 	│   └── user-profile/ 	│       ├── components/ 	│       ├── hooks/ 	│       ├── tests/ 	│       ├── user-profile.service.ts  // Frontend service (e.g., API calls) 	│       └── index.ts 	├── backend/ 	│   ├── features/  // Backend mirrors frontend for alignment 	│   │   └── user-profile/ 	│   │       ├── controllers/ 	│   │       │   └── user-profile.controller.ts 	│   │       ├── services/ 	│   │       │   └── user-profile.service.ts 	│   │       ├── models/ 	│   │       │   └── user-profile.model.ts  // e.g., Prisma schema 	│   │       └── index.ts  // Public API 	│   ├── middleware/  // Global (e.g., auth) 	│   └── utils/       // Shared backend utils 	└── shared/  // Cross-stack (e.g., types, utils)  The shared/ Directory: For code used in 3+ places across frontend/backend. Review quarterly.  2. Naming Conventions: Predictability and Searchability   (Unchanged from previous version for brevity—see above for details.)  3. Granularity & Responsibility: Small and Focused Units   (Unchanged—see above.)  4. State Management: Hierarchical and Localized   (Unchanged—see above.)  5. Dependency Management: Enforce API Contracts   (Unchanged—see above.)  6. Testing: Co-Located and Behavior-Focused   Update: For backend, add unit/integration tests for controllers/services using Jest/Supertest. Include end-to-end tests for full-stack flows (e.g., API to UI).  7. Error Handling and Resilience   Update: Backend: Use centralized error handlers (e.g., Express middleware). Frontend: Integrate with TanStack Query for retry logic.  8. Performance and Accessibility   Update: Add lazy loading for routes (React.lazy/Suspense). For accessibility, use tools like axe-core in tests.  9. Documentation and Code Quality   Update: Include API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI for backend endpoints.  10. New: UI/UX Best Practices   Prioritize user-centered design for an intuitive, delightful experience.  Rule: Follow atomic design—build from atoms (e.g., buttons) to organisms (e.g., forms) to pages. Use compound components for flexibility. Rule: Conduct UX audits: Focus on simplicity, consistency, and feedback (e.g., loading indicators, tooltips). Incorporate user testing early. Rationale: Excellent UX differentiates Augment AI, especially for developers in VS Code. Best Practices:   - Design System: Maintain a shared design system in shared/components/ with Storybook for visualization. - Theming: Use CSS variables or Tailwind for dark/light modes. - i18n: Integrate react-i18next for multi-language support. - Example: For a form, use validation with react-hook-form and provide real-time feedback.  11. New: Responsiveness and Styling   Build mobile-first, responsive UIs that adapt seamlessly.  Rule: Use Tailwind CSS (or styled-components) for utility-first styling. Apply media queries and flex/grid for layouts. Rule: Test on multiple devices; aim for breakpoints at 480px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop). Rationale: Ensures Augment AI works well in VS Code sidebars, web views, or standalone apps. Best Practices:   - Mobile-First: Start with smallest screens; scale up. - Performance: Minify CSS; use responsive images with srcset. - Example:  	// user-avatar.component.tsx 	<div className="w-10 h-10 md:w-12 md:h-12 lg:w-16 lg:h-16 rounded-full bg-gray-200" />    Tip: Use Vite/PostCSS for build-time optimization.  12. New: Data Fetching and Async Management   Handle data efficiently for responsive, real-time experiences.  Rule: Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) for caching, optimistic updates, and error handling in frontend. Rule: Prefer RESTful APIs or GraphQL; avoid direct database access from frontend. Rationale: Reduces boilerplate, improves UX with instant feedback, and scales for AI features (e.g., real-time code suggestions). Best Practices:   - Frontend: Wrap fetches in hooks (e.g., useUserProfileQuery). - Backend: Use pagination, rate limiting. - Example:  	// use-user-profile.hook.ts 	import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'; 	export const useUserProfile = () => useQuery({ queryKey: ['userProfile'], queryFn: fetchUserProfile });    13. New: Backend Structure and Best Practices   Mirror frontend modularity for a scalable, secure backend.  Rule: Use layered architecture: Controllers (handle requests), Services (business logic), Models (data access). Organize by feature under backend/features/. Rule: Secure APIs with JWT/auth middleware; validate inputs with Joi/Zod. Rationale: Ensures backend is as modular and maintainable as frontend, supporting full-stack features like AI integrations. Best Practices:   - Framework: Node.js/Express or NestJS for structure. - Database: Use ORM like Prisma for type-safe queries. - API Design: RESTful endpoints (e.g., /api/user-profile); version APIs (e.g., /v1/). - Security: Implement CORS, HTTPS, and OWASP top 10 protections. - Performance: Cache with Redis; monitor with Prometheus. - Example Structure: See Directory Structure above. - Deployment: Use Docker for containerization; CI/CD with GitHub Actions.  Enforcement and Evolution  - Tools: ESLint/Prettier for code; Stylelint for CSS; SonarQube for quality scans. Add backend linters (e.g., TSLint). - Reviews: Mandate UI/UX reviews in PRs; use Figma for designs. - Evolution: This guide is living—propose changes via issues. Last updated: July 12, 2025.
