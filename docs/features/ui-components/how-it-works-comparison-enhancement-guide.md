# How It Works Page - Comparison Section Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the comparison section in `how-it-works.html` to create a professional side-by-side comparison between Traditional Process and Express Path, meeting all specified requirements.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Consistent Visual Design ✅
- **Identical Layout Structure**: Both columns use the same card-based layout with consistent spacing
- **Consistent Icon Styles**: All icons are 16x16 (h-4 w-4) for list items, 32x32 (h-8 w-8) for headers
- **Same Font Hierarchy**: Consistent text sizes, weights, and spacing throughout
- **Matching Color Schemes**: 
  - Traditional: Red/orange accent colors (red-50, red-100, red-600, red-800)
  - Express Path: Green/blue accent colors (green-50, green-100, green-600, green-800)

### 2. Easy Comparison Format ✅
- **Parallel Column Layout**: Perfect side-by-side comparison on desktop (lg:grid-cols-2)
- **Horizontally Aligned Features**: Three matching sections in each column:
  - Timeline comparison
  - Success Rate comparison  
  - Process Quality comparison
- **Consistent Terminology**: Parallel structure and phrasing across both sides
- **Clear Visual Indicators**: Color-coded icons and badges distinguish problems vs solutions

### 3. Visual Consistency Elements ✅
- **Same Icon Library**: All icons from Heroicons with consistent sizing
- **Uniform Spacing**: Consistent padding (p-6, p-8), margins (mb-4, mb-6), and gaps (gap-8)
- **Uniform Card Styling**: All cards use same rounded-lg, border, and shadow patterns
- **Text Alignment**: Consistent left-aligned text with centered headers

### 4. Clear Differentiation ✅
- **Contrasting Accent Colors**: 
  - Traditional: Red/orange (problems, delays, failures)
  - Express Path: Green/blue (solutions, speed, success)
- **Opposing Icons**: 
  - Traditional: X marks, warning signs, clock icons
  - Express Path: Checkmarks, lightning bolts, success indicators
- **Contrasting Messaging**: Direct opposites highlighted (6-12 months vs 34 days, 30% vs 95% success)
