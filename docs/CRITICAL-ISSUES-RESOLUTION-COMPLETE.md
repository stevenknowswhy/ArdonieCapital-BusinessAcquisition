## üîß DETAILED FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### **1. JavaScript Syntax Error Resolution**
**File:** `assets/js/enhanced-listings.js`
**Issue:** Variable 'style' redeclared causing "Uncaught SyntaxError"
**Fix:** Renamed conflicting variable to 'animationStyles'
```javascript
// Before: const style = document.createElement('style');
// After:  const animationStyles = document.createElement('style');
```

### **2. TypeError Fix in Performance Script**
**File:** `assets/js/performance-optimization.js`
**Issue:** Calling .split() on non-string className (SVG elements)
**Fix:** Added comprehensive type checking
```javascript
const classNameValue = typeof el.className === 'string' 
    ? el.className 
    : el.className.baseVal || el.className.animVal || '';
```

### **3. Content Security Policy Update**
**Files:** `assets/js/security-headers.js`, `scripts/fix-security-accessibility-issues.js`
**Issue:** CodePen script blocked by CSP directive
**Fix:** Added https://cpwebassets.codepen.io to script-src
```javascript
'script-src': [
    "'self'",
    "'unsafe-inline'",
    "https://fonts.googleapis.com",
    "https://cpwebassets.codepen.io", // ‚Üê Added
    "https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"
]
```

### **4. Web App Manifest Creation**
