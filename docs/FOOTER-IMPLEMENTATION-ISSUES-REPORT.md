## üîç VERIFICATION NEEDED

The audit shows that **footer standardization is far from complete**. The recent work on auth and vendor-portal directories was successful, but the majority of the platform still needs footer implementation work.

**Key Questions**:
1. Were the main pages (index.html, about.html, etc.) supposed to have been updated?
2. Should portal pages have standardized footers or custom implementations?
3. Are the missing social media links intentional or an oversight?

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Fix the 4 pages with dynamic loading to prevent 404 errors
2. **High Priority**: Add standardized footers to critical portal pages
3. **Medium Priority**: Complete social media links on major pages
4. **Long Term**: Comprehensive footer standardization across all 114 pages

**The platform currently has significant footer inconsistencies that impact user experience and branding consistency.**
