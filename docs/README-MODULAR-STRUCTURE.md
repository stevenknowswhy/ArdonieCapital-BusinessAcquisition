## 🚀 How to Use the Modular Structure

2. Include it in `index.html` using the JavaScript loading system
3. Follow the existing naming conventions and structure

### Modifying Existing Sections
1. Edit the specific section file in `sections/`
2. Changes will automatically appear on the main page
3. Test the section independently before deployment

### Creating New Pages
1. Copy the structure from `index.html`
2. Include the common components (head, header, footer)
3. Add page-specific sections as needed

## 🎨 Styling Guidelines

### Usage Example
